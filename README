Custom Gentoo overlay for Spotify.

First you need to set up a custom overlay directory.
Just create a directory somewhere and put the path to
it in /etc/make.conf. This can be for instance:

PORTDIR_OVERLAY=/usr/local/custom_overlays

Create the directory and move into it:

 $ mkdir /usr/local/custom_overlays
 $ cd /usr/local/custom_overlays

Spotify would fit under media-sound so create a subdir with that name
and checkout the overlay with the following commands:

 $ mkdir media-sound
 $ cd media-sound/
 $ git clone http://github.com/AlbertVeli/Spotify-Overlay.git spotify

Done!

Now you can install spotify with emerge as usual.

 $ emerge -av spotify

To get the latest changes, move into the spotify directory and run:

 $ git pull

That's all there is to it.
